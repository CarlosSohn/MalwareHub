# Files and File Formats
A malware analyst needs to be aware of the various file formats and how to identify them. In the following sections you can find some useful information for identifying files and formats

## Hexadecimal view
You can use many different tools to view a file in its hexadecimal form. My favourite alternative is using vim. You only have to open a file and type `:%!xxd` inside the command mode. Also, you can use syntax highlighting with `:set ft=xxd`. Finally, revert the hexadecimal view using `:%!xxd -r`
