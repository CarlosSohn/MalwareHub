# Malware analysis lab setup
> Last update 07-03-2022
## Introduction
Any kind of malware analysis requires a safe environment to handle malware, whether it is analyzing malware statically or dynamically or executing it to understand its behavior. A good analysis environment offers quick and easy environment reusability to re-run and re-analyze the malware.

Either a physical machine or a virtual machine can be used for malware analysis.  Nonetheless, it is important to note that most malware includes anti-analysis functionalities to evade detection and analysis, also known as _armoring_. Physical analysis systems are more resilient to anti-evasion techniques compared to VM-based analysis systems. A physical analysis environment requires tools that create system restore points like:

1. Windows System Restore
2. Clonezilla
3. Deep Freeze
4. Time Freeze
5. Norton Ghost
6. Reboot Restore Rx.

A more popular solution is to use a virtual machine (VM), but the disadvantage of using a VM is that the state of the operating system and its files, drivers, and other artifacts doesn’t resemble that of a physical system. However, [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) give you the ability to tune the look of the emulated hardware to closely mimic a physical system, which greatly helps in deceiving the malware that it is running on a physical host and not on some analyst’s VM.
